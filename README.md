# Welcome to WEUNITE!
## Our mission
Our mission is to create a crowdfunding website that provides a higher outcome and is easier and simpler to use than other websites, such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo.
## What makes us different?
We are different from other crowdfunding websites because of our simpler user interface, which makes setting up pages much easier for the end user. We also plan to create reward tiers, meaning that donating users can receive rewards from the crowdfunding company for subscribing, similar to Patreon. It is all up to the user what they plan to do!
## Why choose WEUNITE?
Nah, we'd win. We're better. Obviously. Kickstarter is stinky and IndieGoGo is grimey.
